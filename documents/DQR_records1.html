Upon removal, the field calibration check reported the temperature sensor may have been reading high (&amp;lt; 1 deg C).

In general, the relative humidity may have been subject to drift during this time. The manufacturer characterizes sensor drift at &amp;lt;1% / year. A detailed summary is available in the ARM technical report: https://www.arm.gov/publications/tech_reports/doe-sc-arm-tr-192.pdf</td></tr>
<tr><td>sgpmetE9.b1</td><td>2007-02-06 00:00:00</td><td>2017-09-18 15:02:59</td><td>The temperature/humidity sensor has not been calibrated since 2/6/2007. It failed two 6-month field calibration checks during this time, but has passed field calibration checks after 5/7/2014. 

In comparison with a nearby Mesonet site, there is evidence of the sensor relative humidity reading lower than expected, especially in high humidity/nighttime situations. There is also evidence of a possible small cold bias in the temperature data. An exit calibration will characterize severity when the sensor is replaced.
